      <TextSection label="Regulatory Framework" title="ITAR Compliance at Aegis">
        <p>
          The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), codified at 22 CFR Parts 120-130, implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and regulate the export and temporary import of defense articles and defense services listed on the United States Munitions List (USML). As a developer and manufacturer of counter-UAS defense systems, Aegis Defense Systems is subject to ITAR requirements and maintains comprehensive compliance programs to ensure full adherence to these regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          ITAR compliance is not merely a legal obligation for Aegis — it is a fundamental component of our corporate responsibility and our commitment to U.S. national security. Our compliance program is designed to prevent the unauthorized export, re-export, or transfer of defense articles, technical data, and defense services to unauthorized persons or destinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), is the primary regulatory authority responsible for administering ITAR. Aegis maintains active registration with DDTC and operates under the oversight of our designated Empowered Official, who has the authority to sign license applications and other export control documents on behalf of the company.

      <TextSection label="USML Coverage" title="United States Munitions List Classification">
        <p>
          Aegis counter-UAS defense systems are classified under Category XI (Military Electronics) and Category XII (Fire Control, Laser, Imaging, and Guidance Equipment) of the United States Munitions List. This classification means that all Aegis defense articles, associated technical data, and defense services are subject to ITAR controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, our systems fall under the following USML categories: radar detection and tracking systems designed for military applications (Category XI(a)), electronic countermeasure systems and equipment (Category XI(b)), command and control systems for air defense operations (Category XI(c)), and directed energy systems designed for UAS neutralization (Category XII). Technical data related to the development, production, manufacturing, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance, or modification of these defense articles is also subject to ITAR control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our classification determinations are made in consultation with the DDTC and are reviewed annually to ensure continued accuracy. If there is any question regarding the classification of a specific item, component, or technology, we seek a formal commodity jurisdiction determination from the DDTC.

      <TextSection label="International Operations" title="Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales">
        <p>
          Aegis supports both Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) channels for international customers. All international transfers of Aegis defense articles are conducted under the appropriate authorization, whether through government-to-government FMS cases or DDTC-approved direct commercial licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          For FMS transactions, we work closely with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the relevant military service acquisition office, and the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) to ensure that all transfers are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          For DCS transactions, we conduct thorough due diligence on all prospective end-users and end-uses, verify the legitimacy of procurement requests, obtain necessary end-user certificates, and ensure that all license conditions are fully satisfied before, during, and after the transfer.

      <TextSection label="Prohibited Activities" title="ITAR Prohibitions and Restrictions">
        <p>
          ITAR prohibits the export of defense articles, technical data, and defense services to countries subject to U.S. arms embargoes, including countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Aegis does not engage in any transactions with or for the benefit of embargoed destinations, denied persons, debarred parties, or sanctioned entities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also prohibit any activity that would constitute a violation of ITAR anti-boycott provisions, including participation in or support of international boycotts not sanctioned by the U.S. government. All employees are required to report any requests to furnish boycott-related information or to participate in restrictive trade practices.
