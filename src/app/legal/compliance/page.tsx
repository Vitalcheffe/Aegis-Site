      <TextSection label="Compliance Framework" title="Commitment to Regulatory Excellence">
        <p>
          Aegis Defense Systems operates at the intersection of defense technology, national security, and international law. Our compliance framework is not simply a set of policies — it is a core operational capability that ensures every product we develop, every system we deploy, and every engagement we undertake meets the highest standards of legal and regulatory compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our compliance program is built on three foundational pillars: proactive identification of regulatory requirements across all jurisdictions where we operate, systematic integration of compliance controls into our business processes and technical systems, and continuous monitoring and improvement to adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recognize that in the defense industry, compliance failures carry consequences far beyond financial penalties. They can compromise national security, erode the trust of our government partners, and undermine the legitimacy of our mission. That is why we invest in compliance not as a cost of doing business, but as a strategic imperative.
