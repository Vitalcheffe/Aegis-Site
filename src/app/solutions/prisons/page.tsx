        description="The drone has become the weapon of choice for contraband delivery into correctional facilities — phones, weapons, drugs, and tools dropped into exercise yards from altitude, guided by accomplices operating just beyond the facility perimeter. In 2024, U.S. federal prisons reported over 1,200 confirmed drone contraband attempts, a figure that represents only the incidents that were detected. Aegis prison solutions are specifically tuned for the contraband drone threat profile: small, slow-flying commercial drones approaching from low altitude, often at night. Our system detects these threats at ranges up to 5 kilometers, classifies them by type and payload likelihood, and provides automated interdiction before the drone reaches the facility perimeter. Each interdiction is captured on video with synchronized RF recordings, producing an evidence package that supports prosecution and deters future attempts."

        description="Drone threats don't exist in isolation — they are part of a broader perimeter security challenge that includes fence-line breaches, vehicle approaches, and unauthorized personnel. Aegis prison solutions integrate drone detection with existing physical security infrastructure, correlating aerial threat data with CCTV, fence sensors, and access control systems through a unified command interface. When a drone is detected, the system automatically directs PTZ cameras to track it, alerts perimeter patrol staff via radio and pager, and provides the control room with real-time threat visualization. For facilities with multiple housing units, our modular architecture provides zoned coverage that can expand from a single cell block to an entire complex. The system operates 24/7 with minimal staff, making it practical for facilities with limited security budgets."
