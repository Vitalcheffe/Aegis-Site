      <Callout>
        The counter-UAS challenge is not a problem that any one nation, any one
        company, or any one technology can solve alone. It demands an ecosystem
        — a network of partners who bring complementary capabilities, shared
        intelligence, and unified commitment to the mission of keeping the
        skies safe. At Aegis, partnership is not a business development
        strategy. It is a core architectural principle.
