        In 2016, three defense engineers sat in a warehouse outside Washington,
        D.C., watching a consumer drone carry a two-kilogram payload across a
        restricted military installation — completely undetected by
        billion-dollar air defense systems. They realized that the age of
        unmanned aerial threats had arrived, and the world was utterly
        unprepared.

        description="Our approach to building defense technology is fundamentally different from the legacy defense industry. We start with the operator — the soldier at the forward operating base, the security officer at the airport, the naval commander on the bridge — and design backwards from their operational reality. This means systems that work in electromagnetic-contested environments, that degrade gracefully rather than fail catastrophically, and that require minimal training to operate under stress. We deploy our engineers to operational sites alongside our customers. Every feature in the Aegis platform was requested, tested, and validated by the men and women who use it daily. Our rapid iteration cycles — measured in weeks, not years — ensure that the system evolves at the pace of the threat, not the pace of the procurement cycle. We believe that the best defense technology is the technology that actually gets used, and we engineer every aspect of Aegis to make it the most intuitive, most reliable, and most effective counter-UAS platform in the world."

Nine years later, every major military in the world is racing to deploy counter-drone capabilities, and Aegis is the platform they trust. We didn't predict the future. We listened to the operators who were already living in it."
