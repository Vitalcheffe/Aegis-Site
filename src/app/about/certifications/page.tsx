      <Callout>
        Certification is not a checkbox exercise at Aegis — it is a core
        engineering discipline. Every system we build is designed from the ground
        up to meet or exceed the most demanding military, intelligence, and
        civilian standards in the world. Our compliance architecture is not
        bolted on after the fact; it is woven into the fabric of every line of
        code, every hardware component, and every operational procedure.

Aegis was the first counter-UAS platform to achieve STANAG 4671 certification, passing all evaluation criteria on the first attempt — a feat that NATO assessment officials described as unprecedented. The certification covers detection range, classification accuracy, false alarm rates, electromagnetic compatibility, cybersecurity posture, and multi-national data interoperability. STANAG 4671 certification is required for any counter-UAS system deployed within NATO's integrated air and missile defense architecture, and Aegis's certification has been renewed three times since initial approval in 2019.",
