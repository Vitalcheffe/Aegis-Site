        Aegis graduated response architecture ensures that every countermeasure is
        proportionate to the threat, compliant with rules of engagement, and
        executed with full audit trail — from RF jamming and GPS spoofing through
        directed energy and kinetic interception, operators choose the right tool
        for the right threat at the right time.

        description="Precision directional jamming disrupts drone command-and-control links and GPS navigation with surgical selectivity — neutralizing the threat while minimizing collateral interference to friendly communications and civilian infrastructure. Cognitive jamming algorithms adapt in real-time to frequency-hopping and spread-spectrum protocols, maintaining disruption effectiveness against even the most sophisticated anti-jam receivers. Power management ensures that jamming energy is focused on the target with spillover reduced by 40 dB, enabling safe operation near airports and populated areas."

The Aegis DEW module engages targets at ranges up to 3 km with continuous-wave and pulsed modes optimized for different airframe materials — melting plastic housings, detonating explosive payloads, or disabling control surfaces with surgical precision. Adaptive optics compensate for atmospheric turbulence in real-time, maintaining beam quality and spot size across the full engagement envelope."

The fire control solution leverages the same tracking and classification data that drives the kill chain, ensuring first-round hit probability above 97%. Integration supports both gun-based and missile-based interceptors with automatic ballistic computation, wind compensation, and lead angle optimization."
