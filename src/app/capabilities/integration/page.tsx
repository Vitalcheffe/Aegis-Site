        No defense system operates in isolation. Aegis Integrator connects to
        third-party sensors, effectors, and command networks through open
        standards and custom adapters — ensuring that your existing investments
        in radar, cameras, jammers, and C2 infrastructure contribute to the
        unified counter-UAS fight.

              "Full compliance with NATO STANAG 4671 enables seamless data exchange with allied counter-UAS systems. Aegis publishes and consumes standard track messages, sensor tasking requests, and engagement orders — ensuring interoperability in coalition operations where multiple nations contribute sensors and effectors to a shared air picture. STANAG compliance has been validated through NATO CWIX exercises with 8 allied nations.",

Bi-directional data flows enable tasking from higher-echelon JADC2 nodes and reporting of engagement results back to the joint force — closing the sensor-to-shooter loop across domain boundaries.",

Every detected drone appears as a georeferenced icon on the operator's ATAK display with classification data, threat level, and recommended action. ATAK push notifications alert operators to approaching threats even when the device is stowed — providing critical seconds of additional reaction time at the tactical edge.",

Custom adapter development for proprietary or legacy systems typically takes 4–6 weeks, with full integration testing and validation included.",

Effector status, availability, and engagement results are visible in the common operating picture, enabling coordinated response across heterogeneous effector fleets.",

The SDK supports custom data ingestion, third-party track publishing, and effector control — with sub-100ms latency guarantees and automatic schema evolution that maintains backward compatibility across Aegis software updates.",
